# Liberdus Status – Frontend Only

This document only covers how to run the **frontend** and point it at an existing status backend.

## Files

- `index.html` – main page for the status dashboard.
- `style.css` – layout and styles.
- `main.js` – frontend logic that talks to the backend API.

## Connecting to the backend

The frontend calls a small backend service that exposes:

- `GET /api/summary`
- `GET /api/history`
- `GET /health`

By default, the frontend expects the backend at:

- `http://localhost:7070`

You can change this in two ways.

### Option 1: Use window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API (recommended)

Before loading `main.js`, set `window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API` in `index.html`:

```html
<script>
  window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API = "https://status.example.com";
</script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

If `window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API` is set to a string, the frontend uses it as the base URL for all API calls.

### Option 2: Use the default localhost URL

If you do **not** set `window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API`, the frontend uses:

```js
http://localhost:7070
```

Make sure your backend is listening on that host and port.

## Choosing the network (Devnet vs Testnet)

The frontend has a network dropdown in the top-right of the “Service status” card:

- **Devnet** (default)
- **Testnet**

This control changes the `?network=` query parameter sent to the backend, so the same dashboard can show either Devnet or Testnet data from the same backend.

You do not need to edit the code to switch networks; just use the dropdown.

## How to open the frontend

For simple usage:

1. Ensure the backend is running and reachable (for example at `http://localhost:7070` or your configured URL).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click it or serve it with a static web server).
3. If you changed the backend URL, confirm:
   - Either `window.LIBERDUS_STATUS_API` is set correctly in `index.html`, **or**
   - The backend is running at `http://localhost:7070`.

The dashboard should load and start showing the current status and uptime history from the configured backend.
