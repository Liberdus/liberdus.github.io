# liberdus-token-ui

Liberdus Token UI - User interface for Liberdus token operations.

## Getting Started

Phase 1 includes the static SPA shell (tabs + placeholder panels).

To run locally (needs a static server because we use ES modules):

- `python3 -m http.server 8080`
- or `npx serve` (from repo root)
